                Hello! My name is Siosaia Akau, but I go by Afi (off-ee). I was born and raised in West Point, Utah, where I spent the first 19
                years of my life. I attended Syracuse High while also attending Weber State University, and by the end of my high school
                career, I recieved my associates degree. I was also a barista for 1.5 years at a coffee house called, Beans and Brews, which
                sparked my love for coffee. Now, I attend the University of Southern California where I am getting my bacherlors in
                Business Administration. My hobbies include skateboarding, listening to music, and gaming. I am trying to learn to cook
                and code at Berkley's Bootcamp!
